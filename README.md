## Mission Pulse

- **Production focus** – Hardened documentation, deterministic quality gates, and custody-aware controls allow non-technical owners to launch within minutes.
- **Identity rigor** – Every runtime must control an ENS signature `⟨label⟩.alpha.node.agi.eth`; the machine self-checks ownership on boot, heartbeat, and before settlement.
- **Unified economy** – `$AGIALPHA` (`0xa61a3b3a130a9c20768eebf97e21515a6046a1fa`, 18 decimals) powers staking, slashing, rewards, and reinvestment. No ETH settlement paths exist in production flows.
- **Owner supremacy** – Governance levers cover min-stake thresholds, emission splits, pausing, module upgrades, and delegate rotation.
- **Outcome** – Deterministic world-model planning, antifragile stress harnesses, and auto-reinvestment loops keep wealth compounding and reputation accelerating.
- **Field dominance** – The node is engineered to be the asset referenced when people speak about machines that can overturn legacy economic orders; you hold the reins.

## Operator Launch Sequence

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MontrealAI/AGI-Alpha-Node-v0.git
cd AGI-Alpha-Node-v0
npm ci
npm run lint:md     # mirrors the CI markdown gate
npm run lint:links  # mirrors the CI link validation gate
npm run lint        # optional aggregate run for local confidence logs
```

1. Secure your ENS subdomain under `alpha.node.agi.eth` and map resolver/wrapper ownership to the operator wallet.
2. Register delegate keys with `IdentityRegistry.setAdditionalNodeOperator` if using multisig or HSM custody.
3. Fund the operator wallet with `$AGIALPHA` plus gas, approve Stake Manager allowances, then execute `PlatformIncentives.stakeAndActivate(amount)` (or `_acknowledgeStakeAndActivate`).
4. Deploy the runtime via container, Kubernetes, or enclave workflows described in the [codex](docs/README.md#system-constellation).
5. Enforce GitHub branch protections: require **Continuous Integration**, approving reviews, and status check visibility on every PR and `main` push so the badge stays green.
6. Record proof of ENS control, staking tx hashes, and CI output in your custody ledger to satisfy audits and institutional policy.

## Identity, Staking & Treasury Control

- `verifyNode(label, proof)` locks every runtime to its ENS identity and halts if resolver/NameWrapper ownership diverges.
- `PlatformIncentives.stakeAndActivate(amount)` sequences allowance, deposit, registry enrollment, and job router registration in one transaction.
- `StakeManager.slash(role, operator, treasuryShare, burnShare)` routes penalties instantly according to owner-set ratios; withdrawals use `StakeManager.withdrawStake` after cooldowns.
- `PlatformRegistry.setMinPlatformStake(amount)` and `StakeManager.setMinStake(role, amount)` let owners raise or lower thresholds dynamically.
- Rewards stream through job escrow (`StakeManager.release`) and epoch emissions (`FeePool.claimRewards`) with optional autopilot reinvestment.

---

## Autonomy & Intelligence Stack

- **World-model planner** – Multi-armed bandit simulations forecast ROI, curriculum fit, and specialist synergy before any bid is placed.
- **Specialist mesh** – Deterministic micro-agents (finance, legal, infra, biotech, creative, compliance) coordinate through an orchestrator with sub-millisecond overhead.
- **Antifragile sentinel** – Stress harness escalates guardrails, tunes difficulty cursors, and ensures volatility drives improvement rather than regression.
- **Compliance ledger** – Structured reasoning traces are hashed for disputes, audits, and regulatory inspection.
- **Autopilot evolution** – Curriculum learning and reinvestment loops expand stake weight, routing priority, and intelligence without manual babysitting.

---

## Owner Command & Safety Lattice

- `SystemPause.pauseAll()` and `unpauseAll()` give owners immediate stop/resume authority across Job Registry, Stake Manager, Validation Module, and allied components.
- Emission tuning flows through `RewardEngineMB.setRoleShare(role, shareBps)` and validator percentage setters.
- `PlatformRegistry.register()` / `deregister()` plus Identity Registry allowlists enable rapid operator rotation or quarantine of compromised keys.
- Module endpoints such as `PlatformRegistry.setReputationEngine(address)` and `JobRegistry.setValidationModule(address)` allow safe upgrades under owner signatures.
- Commit-reveal validation and dispute hooks provide verifiable arbitration without sacrificing autonomy or speed.

### Owner Control Matrix

| Lever | Function | Owner Impact |
| ----- | -------- | ------------ |
| Minimum Stake Policy | `PlatformRegistry.setMinPlatformStake(amount)` / `StakeManager.setMinStake(role, amount)` | Raise or relax bonding requirements instantly to calibrate risk appetite. |
| Reward Emissions | `RewardEngineMB.setRoleShare(role, shareBps)` | Redistribute epoch emissions across agents, validators, platforms, or treasury in response to economic conditions. |
| Runtime Delegation | `IdentityRegistry.setAdditionalNodeOperator(operator, allowed)` | Rotate hot keys, revoke compromised delegates, and maintain multisig or HSM separation of duties. |
| Module Upgrades | `PlatformRegistry.setReputationEngine(address)` / `JobRegistry.setValidationModule(address)` | Swap core logic components without downtime while preserving auditability. |
| Emergency Response | `SystemPause.pauseAll()` / `SystemPause.unpauseAll()` | Freeze or resume the entire labor pipeline in a single transaction during incidents. |
| Stake Recovery | `StakeManager.withdrawStake(role, amount)` and `StakeManager.slash(...)` | Redeploy bonded capital or enforce penalties aligned with governance policies. |

## Continuous Integration & Branch Protection

- [`Continuous Integration`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs on every push and pull request targeting `main`, executing `npm ci`, `npm run lint:md`, and `npm run lint:links` as discrete gates for immediate evidence.
- Keep the badge green: reproduce the workflow locally with `npm ci` followed by `npm run lint`, `npm run lint:md`, and `npm run lint:links` before opening a PR.
- Surface CI status in PR templates and release checklists so every deploy stays auditable and traceable.
- During repository setup, visit **Settings → Branches → Branch protection rules → main** and explicitly require the **Continuous Integration** workflow and conversation resolution so the GitHub UI blocks merges that would dim the badge.

### Branch Protection Walkthrough

1. Navigate to **Settings → Branches → main**.
2. Enable **Require a pull request before merging** and **Require approvals** (set to at least one reviewer).
3. Enable **Require status checks to pass before merging** and select **Continuous Integration** from the checks list.
4. Enable **Require branches to be up to date before merging** so outdated merges cannot bypass the lint gates.
5. Enable **Do not allow bypassing the above settings** and block force pushes/deletions to keep the audit trail pristine.
6. Capture screenshots or export the policy JSON into your custody ledger so future audits can confirm enforcement without ambiguity.

### CI Evidence Matrix

| Evidence Vector | Location | Proof Signal |
| ---------------- | -------- | ------------ |
| Workflow Definition | [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) | Node.js 20.x, `npm ci`, `npm run lint:md`, `npm run lint:links` gates |
| Status Dashboard | [Actions Panel](https://github.com/MontrealAI/AGI-Alpha-Node-v0/actions) | Visual confirmation of passing checks on `main` and all pull requests |
| Required Check | GitHub → Settings → Branches → `main` | **Continuous Integration** enforced as mandatory status check |
| Local Mirror | `npm ci && npm run lint:md && npm run lint:links` | Developer evidence pack before PR submission |

## Operational Quality Checklist

| Stage | Owner Action | Reference |
| ----- | ------------ | --------- |
| **Branch Protection** | GitHub → Settings → Branches → `main` → enable “Require a pull request before merging”, “Require status checks to pass”, require approving reviews, and select **Continuous Integration**. | [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests) |
| **Visibility** | Pin the CI badge and [checks index](https://github.com/MontrealAI/AGI-Alpha-Node-v0/actions) in internal portals so stakeholders see real-time status. | [Badge](https://github.com/MontrealAI/AGI-Alpha-Node-v0/actions/workflows/ci.yml) |
| **Secrets Hygiene** | Rotate GitHub Action secrets quarterly; no private keys belong in workflows because staking and operations occur on-chain under owner custody. | Security policy |
| **Pre-Flight** | Run `npm run lint:md`, `npm run lint:links`, and (optionally) `npm run lint` locally or in a Codespace before every PR to mirror CI, then archive logs with the PR description. | Local CLI |
| **Post-Merge** | Monitor the pipeline run triggered by merging to `main`. Keep a rollback branch ready; the pause lever (`SystemPause.pauseAll()`) is your final safeguard. | [CI Workflow](.github/workflows/ci.yml) |

Document the outcomes of each stage in your ops journal so audits can replay every decision that kept the machine perfectly green.

## Deployment & Observability Mesh

| Profile | Launch Vector | Owner Notes |
| ------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| **One-Click Compose** | `docker compose --profile core up --build` using the provided sample environment. | Ideal for rapid pilots; mounts volumes for ledgers, telemetry, and keystore artifacts so restarts remain deterministic. |
| **Hardened VM** | Provision Ubuntu LTS, install Docker + Node.js 20.x, then run the same compose bundle in an air-gapped subnet. | Pair with an HSM or remote keystore service; restrict outbound traffic to Ethereum RPC, IPFS gateways, and approved webhooks. |
| **Kubernetes / Helm** | Scaffold a chart (`helm create agi-alpha-node` or `kompose convert`) and push it to your internal registry, then `helm install agi-alpha-node <your-chart-ref> -f values.yaml`. | Enables rolling upgrades, replica orchestration, and integration with Prometheus/Grafana stacks out of the box. |
| **Enterprise Mesh** | Deploy multiple ENS identities (one container per identity) behind a service mesh or API gateway. | Each identity maintains its own stake, ledger, and custody profile; mesh distributes job intake according to planner telemetry. |

- **Offline resilience** – Runtime tolerates API outages by falling back to local inference bundles; deterministic replay keeps compliance ledgers verifiable even in disconnected enclaves.
- **Secrets discipline** – Load hot keys from Vault/HSM endpoints via environment variables (`KEYSTORE_URL`, `KEYSTORE_TOKEN`) or mount encrypted keyfiles; never bake secrets into images.
- **Observability autopilot** – Prometheus scrapes `/metrics`, Alertmanager fans critical events into PagerDuty/Slack, and Grafana dashboards (SLOs, antifragility, treasury) ship as JSON for instant import.
